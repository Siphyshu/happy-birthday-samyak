										<p>Hey samyak! I don't know how to write good, sweet stuff but I guess I'll try. You are a very weird human who's different from all. They say having a sense of humor means when you can take a joke instead of making one and I guess that is very apt for someone like you. I like how carefree you are about certain things and the fact that you are kind of always there for your friends irrespective of how much they bully you,also I like how you stick to your own personality its cool. Anyways HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HOPE YOU ACHIEVE WHATEVER YOU WISH TO ❤.</p>

							<h3>Eves,<br>
								This may be the only day you get to hear (technically read) this but you've got no idea how much do you inspire me and make me proud each day of your existence. You are one of the most talented people I know. (And trust me I'm not saying this because I'm your sister. Infact that is the last thing I would like you to know.) One of the most empathetic men in probably the entire world. And obviously THE MOST annoying yet adorably cute brother in this world. The amount of weirdness that is within you is probably the biggest secret that you have and the I'm super glad that I'm one of the exclusive witness of it. (Although, the same holds true vice versa too). 
								I might love you the most in this world. (I hate to admit it but it's true.)
								<br><br>
								To more of our weirdness, the warmest bear hugs,<br> and that cute little til on your cheek!<br>
								Love,<br>
